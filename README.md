# BST & Knight Travails

Binary Search Tree (BST) and Knight Travails projects from The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum.
I'd done BST before so it was a good refresher. However, I'd never done Knight Travails before so it was a good challenge. The problem was to find the shortest path for a knight to move from one square to another on a chess board, given the starting and ending squares. It took me a week to figure out how to effectively traverse a n-tree (where n is the possible moves a knight can make from it's current position) and find the shortest path, using Iterative Deepening Search.

~~**Planned**: Add a GUI to let the user select the starting and ending squares, and show the path the knight takes.~~
Learned what I intended with this project, and since my priorities have changed a bit, therefore archiving.
